# Arduino Projects

This repo stores some of the projects I made for my Arduino UNO R3.
All of these require certain parts, specified in each project folder's `README`.

## HouseGuard
A device that utilizes the SR-04's wave technology to make an alert when an object is within 300cm of the sensor.

*Find more details on HouseGuard in `ArduinoProjects/HouseGuard`.*

## Sonar
A device that utilizes the SR-04 and Servo to scan surrondings and look towards the object that is closest to the sensor.

*Find more details on Sonar in `ArduinoProjects/Sonar`.*
