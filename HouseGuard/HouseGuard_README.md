# HouseGuard
**Created by Ben Myers**

A device that utilizes the SR-04's wave technology to make an alert when an object is within 300cm of the sensor.

## Required Parts

**Primary stuff**
*These materials are required for construction of the circuit.*
- 1x Elegoo UNO R3
- 1x pegboard
- 2x male-to-male jumper wires
- 3x 220Ω resistors

**The LED**
*This will make a rainbow light when an object arrives in range, or it will flash green when active.*
- 1x LED
- 3x male-to-male jumper wires
- 3x 220Ω resistors

**The sensor**
*This will determine the closest distance between itself and an object.*
- 1x HC-SRO4 (SR-04) Ultrasonic sensor module
- 4x female-to-male DuPont wires

**The alarm (optional)**
*When an object is close to the SR-04, this will make a random pitched noise.*
- 1x passive buzzer
- 2x female-to-male DuPont wires

**The motor (optional)**
*When an object is close to the SR-04, this will spin. Very useless, but fun to look at.*
- 1x SG90 servo
- 3x male-to-male jumper wires
